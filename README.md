# Gateway App (Wireframe)

This is a wireframe for an app I'm planning to develop called **Gateway**.

**Gateway** is a smart access control application that allows users to open their home or community gates directly from their mobile devices. The goal is to simplify and modernize secure entry by replacing physical remotes or keypads with an easy-to-use mobile solution.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the Wireframe
- Visualize the user interface before development begins
- Map out the main functions: opening gates, starring favorites, and activity tracking
- Plan a clean, intuitive layout for smooth user experience

## ðŸ”’ Key Features (Planned)
- One-tap gate opening
- Favorite/most-used gate shortcuts
- Simple, secure design for all users
